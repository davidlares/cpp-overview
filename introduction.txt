  IDE => Integrated Development Environments
    * IDE is not a compiler, but most of it comes with the compiler
    * Comes with a text editor -> syntax highlighting, project management, source-control integration, etc

==========

  #include <iostream>   -> preprocessor directive (including a preexisting file on the project)
                        -> include some native useful functions

  using namespace std;  -> namespace C ++ standard library (for usage of cout p.e)
                        -> we are going to use functions from the STD, allocated on the IOSTREAM

  int main(){           -> THIS IS THE ENTRY POINT (should returns a INT VALUE or expecting)

    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;  -> PRINT a string on the console

  }
